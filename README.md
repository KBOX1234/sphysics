# Simple Physics Library

This project is a small lightweight physics engine<br>
This was made by a dyslexic 15-year-old in his mom's basement so sorry for the bad spelling<br>
This library is not a full-on physics engine but aims to give you the tools to do so yourself <br>
The library is made to be as flexible as possible meaning that it will run on practically anything, with the only<br>
soft requirement being that your CPU has an FPU (still runs but is slower without). It will also work with any game engine/graphics library.<br>
It's released under the LGPL 2.1 license so it's free to use in any project (some credit would be nice tho :).<br>


#### If you don't like the spelling just dm me some corrected code at kboxkbox1234@gmail.com

## Setting up
The only requirement is to have math.h installed (it probably is already installed)<br>
<br>
Just dump the sphysics.h and the lib folder in your project and include it<br>
<br>
Simplest build command: <code>gcc your_file.c -o your_program</code><br><br>

If you want to run the included demo, you will need to install <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a> which is the graphics library used to visualize everything.<br>
You don't need raylib to use the library<br>

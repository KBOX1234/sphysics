# Simple Physics library

This project is a small lighweight physics engine<br>
This was made by a dislexic 15 year old in his moms basment so sorry for bad spelling<br>
This library is not a full on physics engine but aimes to give you the tools to do so your self<br>
The library is made to be as flexible as possible. It will run on practicaly anything, with the only<br>
soft requirement being that your CPU has an FPU (still runs but is slower without)<br>
Its released under the LGPL 2.1 license so its free to use in any project.<br>

#### if you don't like the spelling just dm me some corrected code at kboxkbox1234@gmail.com
